# random-rough-terrain
Files to generate 3D printable random rough terrain for robotics research. These files create a random terrain based upon user settings, and the terrain, saved as an STL file, can be printed with a 3D printer. The terrains were inspired by the work by Spongberg et al. in Neuromechanical response of musculo-skeletal structures in cockroaches during rapid running on rough terrain (https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.012385).

To generate an STL file for terrain, the files STL_map_generation.m, cube_faces.m, and cube_verticies.m are needed along with stlwrite.m from the MATLAB file exchange (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20922-stlwrite-write-ascii-or-binary-stl-files)
